# Lab | Random Forests

For this lab, you will be using the CSV files provided in the `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

- Apply the Random Forests algorithm but this time only by upscaling the data.
- Discuss the output and its impact in the bussiness scenario. Is the cost of a false positive equals to the cost of the false negative? How would you change your algorithm or data in order to maximize the return of the bussiness?


# Lab | Final regression model in "Health Care for All" Case
Instructions
At this point, we have created a model to predict who will make a donation and who won't. But, what about the ammount of money that each person will give? In this lab, subset those that made a donation and use that subset to create a model to predict how much money will they give.

Evaluate the result of your model and estimate how much better the result are for the bussiness in comparison with the naive scenario we discuss on Monday
